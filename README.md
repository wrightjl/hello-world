# hello-world
# Making angels in the New Snow of my github account.
# I'm a step or two past Python infant.
# * I've completed the CodeAcademy course in Python
# * I've worked my way through Automate the Boring Stuff with Python
# * I've watched my share of YouTube videos from Raymond Hettinger, Al Sweigart, etc.
# ...but, I haven't done much original with Python. Yet.
# I test commercial Windows software, and am learning test automation using Python
